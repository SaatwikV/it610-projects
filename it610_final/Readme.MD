<h1>SHOPPING CART PROJECT</h1>


<h3>HTML/CSS and JS</h3>

<p> This project's sole purpose is to be able to collect products listed in the product's section and add them to the cart. The cart itself must be able to store the content collected as well as increase/decrease the quantity or delete the product as a whole. Overall for the project, I used JS local DOM storage for the backend functionality and HTML/CSS for the frontend landing page.</p>
